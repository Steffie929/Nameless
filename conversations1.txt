(Rude) Stranger:
Hello, you look like you are a local here *lets hope you're more useful than the others*. 
Can you help me with something? 

- Sure friend, what do you need?
*Sigh* Let's skip the pleasantries. Have you heard about any unusual events recently? Unusually aggressive wildlife, 
natural disasters or something similar?

- Well, now that you mention it the animals here have become really aggressive lately.
Interesting, the artefact must be here * evil laugh*. I have a proposal for you. Should you find a strange artefact 
somewhere in the area bring it to me and I will reward you very generously.

- No, things are pretty much the same as always.
Hmm, that's too bad. Well if you happen to come across an artefact, bring it to me and I will reward you very generously.

- Well, the sky turned green yesterday and I did see some flying elephants...
Insolent fool, I don't have time to play games. If you happen to come across an artefact, bring it to me and I will reward you very generously.
I wouldn't suggest keeping it, I doubt you will like the consequences..


- Depends, what do you want

Actually it is my business. But I will make you a deal. If you happen to come across an artefact, bring it to me and I will reward you very generously.
I wouldn't suggest keeping it, I doubt you will like the consequences..

- I don't have time for this. Get lost.
How dare you speak to me that way! I am .. from ... You will regret this!
