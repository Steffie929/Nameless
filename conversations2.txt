Whew, that was one tough fight. And one really weird wolf. Wolves arent suppose dto act that way right? 
It seems the whole world has gone crazy. Maybe that floating skeleton was actually telling the truth. 
Maybe all these weird events aren't random, they could be caused by something. But do I really want to get involved with this?

-1 Hell yes! 
-2 It can't hurt to find out more.
-3 No way, I'm out of here.

1: 
If there really is something going on here I want to know exactly what it is, why it's happening and maybe
I can do something about it. 
Let's see, that wolf was the strangest monster yet, so if the artefact exists, it has to be somewhere around here.
*Got something* This must be it!

If there really is something going on here I should probable find out what it is. I can always walk away later.

This is all way too weird and too dangerous! I'm going to forget anything happend, it's time to go home!
*BAM* Ouch, stupid forest. I'm outside for 5 minutes and already tripping over things. Hey, wait a second.
This must be that artefact the skeleton was talking about!

==========================================================================================
Okay, I found the artefact. Now what do I do?

-1 I should find that skeleton and give it to him, he seemed like he knew what he was talking about
-2 I'll keep it with me for now, but i really should find someone who knows more about this thing.
-3 This might be worth something. Time to find a buyer.

One problem, I don't know where that skeleton went. But I believe there is an old hermit in 
the desert a little west of here who is supposedly an expert in weird stuff. Let's go talk to him.

To sell it, I first have to know what it is. I believe there is an old hermit in
